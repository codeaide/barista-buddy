## About Me

I am very passionate about software engineering. I enjoy writing code and problem solving using software. Being a coffee afficionado, I always wanted to automate parts of the coffee brewing process to make it more effecient and satisfying.

## Flair Classic - My First Love

Even though I used the V60 dripper, Bodum French Press and Bialetti Moka Express, my real coffee journey started after I bought the Flair Classic. I learnt the impact of temeprature on the brewing process. Despite using temperature strips, the temperature management was difficult and the machine lacked steaming capabilities. Therefore I switched to La Pavoni Europiccola.

## La Pavoni Europiccola - A Vintage Beauty

The Europiccola is a simple but ingenious machine. I could pull really amazing shots with it and with the single-hole steam tip, I could do some amature latte art too. Unlike the Flair Classic, there are several after-market solutions available for Europiccola for pressure and temperature profiling. As always these are expensive.

During my search for DIY projects, I stumbled upon the [Koffie](https://github.com/mwood77/koffie) project by mwood77. There are several such Arduino based PID projects but I was very inspired by the simple and 100% reversible approach mwood77 took. Since the solution was designed and developed specifically for the Europiccola, adopting it would have been relatively easy.

## ECM Classika II - Stepping Up

Around this time when I was thinking of making use of mwood77's work, I found a used ECM Classika II (without PID). I've read good reviews about the machine and the price was too good to pass up! :)

Unlike the Europiccola, the Classika II does not have a provision for measuring the boiler pressure required by [Koffie](https://github.com/mwood77/koffie). I would have also loved to use a Smartphone as the interface to the device rather than having physical buttons, knobs, display and a 3D printed enclosure to house the electronics. This is why I decided to create a new project.
